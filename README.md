# What is CuteText?

> I love the [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) editor. But one thing that scares me though is that it lacks a context window which automatically displays symbol definitions based on what identifier your cursor is in, or what symbol or file is selected in any panel. The context window is a wonderful feature in [Source Insight](https://www.sourceinsight.com/) which I really love. Furthermore, Sublime Text is not open sourced and thus is hard to add some features I love. 
> So I decided I had to create my own text editors like Sublime Text and combine it with some other features(e.g., The context window feature in Source Insight).
