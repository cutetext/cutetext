# CuteText

Welcome to the open source project for CuteText.

# What is CuteText?

> I love the [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) editor. But one thing that scares me though is that it lacks a context window which automatically displays symbol definitions based on what identifier your cursor is in, or what symbol or file is selected in any panel. The context window is a wonderful feature in [Source Insight](https://www.sourceinsight.com/) which I really love. Furthermore, Sublime Text is not open sourced and thus is hard to add some features I love. 
> So I decided I had to create my own text editors like Sublime Text and combine it with some other features(e.g., The context window feature in Source Insight).

# Goals

- [ ] 100% Open source
- [ ] Compatible with Textmate color schemes (which is what ST is using)
- [ ] Compatible with Textmate syntax definitions (which again is what ST is using)
- [ ] Compatible with Textmate snippets
- [ ] Compatible with Sublime Text’s python plugin API. I’ll probably never implement this 100%, only the api bits I need for the plugins I use.
- [ ] Compatible with Sublime Text’s keybindings and settings (think most of it is working)
- [ ] Compatible with Sublime Text snippets
- [ ] Sublime Text’s Goto anything panel
- [ ] Multiple cursors
- [ ] Support for plugging in a custom parser for more advanced syntax highlighting.
- [ ] Context window like the one in Source Insight
- [ ] Cross platform(Windows, Mac OSx and Linux)
